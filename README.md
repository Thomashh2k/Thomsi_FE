> This code is only to demonstrate my skills for job interviews, but hopefully, in the future there will be a production ready version of this code.

## About
This software is a headless CMS which goes in a different way how things work than any other headless CMSs.
The design pattern of the software follows the rule of separation of concern **[Frontend](https://github.com/Thomashh2k/Thomsi_FE) -> [Backend](https://github.com/Thomashh2k/Thomsi_API) -> [Database](https://github.com/Thomashh2k/Thomsi_DB)** 
It is made with **Vue + Typescript** with additional libraries worth mentioning that are listed below:
